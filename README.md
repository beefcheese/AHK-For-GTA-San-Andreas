## Setting Up:
<ol>
	1. Go to **Controller Settings** and click **Restore Defaults**.
	2. Change input controls to use Gamepad instead of Mouse + Keyboard
	3. Manually change all the foot controls so that the Left Trigger is Aim and Right Trigger is Fire. No other
		joystick buttons should be assigned.
	4. Use backspace to remove all keybindings for Sprint and then bind **j** to be the Sprint button.
	5. Manually change all the vehicle controls so that Left Trigger is Brake/Reverse and Right Trigger is Accelerate.
		No other joystick buttons should be assigned.
	6. Use backspace to remove all keybindings for Handbrake and then bind **Space** to be the Handbrake button.
</ol>
## Using the Controls:
There are two different modes. **Bicycle Mode** and **Driving Mode**. By default, you start in driving mode.
	To change which mode you are using, hold the Right Bumper and then quickly press and release the A button. In **Driving
	Mode**, the A button is Handbrake. In **Bicycle Mode**, the A button is Accelerate.
## Trouble Shooting:
If you run San Andreas in a way that requires the game to run as an administrator, e.g. In windows compatability mode,
	you must also run the AutoHotKey script as an administrator.
